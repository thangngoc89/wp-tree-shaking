## Build command

* `npm run base-line` base line ~ 9.07KB
* `npm run bs` files generated by Bucklescript. ~16.7KB

---

Explanation for files inside `src/`

* `*.re` source files.
* `DateFns.js` generated binding by Bucklescript. I tried everything to trimmed down this file.
  This file contains funcitons with no side effects.

* `bs.js` this uses `DateFns.js` with only 1 function: `format`
* `base-line.js` hand written code that does the same thing with `bs.js`
  This is the version I imagine webpack could tree-shaking to.
